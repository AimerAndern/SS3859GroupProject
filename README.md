## Intruduction
This project is completed jointly by Yixu Wang,  Jiaqi Dong, Rui Zhu.<br/>

## The dataset used can be found from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Beijing+PM2.5+Data<br/> 
<br/>

## It contains following parts:<br/>
  ### Early steps<br/>
  ### 1. Calculate p-value for each predictor (Single parameter test)(RuiZhu)<br/>
  ### 2. Come out with some hypothese that which predictors are not significant (Nested model + ANOVA)(Rui Zhu)<br/>
  ### 3. Test for interactions (details yet to come)(Rui Zhu)<br/>
  ### 4. Model diagnostics <br/>
      ###### 4.1 Linearity<br/>
      ###### 4.2 Normality<br/>
      ###### 4.3 Equal variance<br/>
      ###### 4.4 Independence using time series (difficult)<br/>
  ### 5. Check for unusual observations (Cook's distance for outliers or graphs)<br/>
  ### 6. See if response transformation is needed (Variance stabilization or box-cox transformation)<br/>
  ### 7. Check if predictors have multicollinearity (VIF)<br/>


  ### Finishing up
  ### 8. Variable selection (which variables to keep, based on previous results and AIC, BIC or PRESS test)
  ### 9. Come to conclusion and finish report
